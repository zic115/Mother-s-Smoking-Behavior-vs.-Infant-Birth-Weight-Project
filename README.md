This is the first project for MATH183 @UCSD.

The course instructor, Professor Perinaz Ezzati, provided several datasets for the students to choose from, and I chose the dataset `Bwghtgrams.csv` to explore the relationship between infant birth rate and mother's smoking behavior. This topic grabbed my attention as I happened to be valunteering at the school's hospital where I heard the nurse station talking about a mother who smokes regularly gave birth to a weak baby.

The analysis was done using R, so a R markdown named `Project 1.Rmd` was included.

To see the report, you can go to `Project 1.html`.
